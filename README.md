A simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Python.
This project simulates a basic match between the computer (playing as X) and the user (playing as O).
Designed based on the project requirements from the learning task.

''Project Overview''

This program allows a human user to play Tic-Tac-Toe against the computer in a simplified setup.
The computer always makes the first move and places its X in the center position of the board.

The board uses numbers 1 to 9, arranged row-by-row:
1 | 2 | 3
---------
4 | 5 | 6
---------
7 | 8 | 9
------------------------------------------
